A decision tree is a popular tree structure used in Machine Learning and Data Science
to make decisions or predictions based on data. Each internal node represents a condition,
each branch represents a decision path, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

## Example

        Is Student?
        /         \
      Yes         No

## Key Components

- Root Node: first decision (e.g., "Is Student?")
- Decision Nodes: further conditions/questions
- Leaf Nodes: final result or prediction
- Branches: paths based on Yes/No or conditions

## Where It Is Used

- Email spam detection
- Loan approval systems
- Medical diagnosis
- Product recommendation
- Marketing classification
- Business decision making

## Why It Relates to Tree Data Structures

Decision trees follow:
- hierarchical structure
- parent-child relationships
- branches & leaves
- traversal logic

Therefore, they are a real-world application
of tree data structures.
