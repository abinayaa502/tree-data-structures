# Tree Data Structures

This repository contains implementations and examples of fundamental and intermediate
tree data structures including Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees,
and real-world applications.

---

## Tree Structures Implemented

### Binary Tree
- Node creation
- Adding children
- Recursive printing

### Tree Traversals
- Inorder
- Preorder
- Postorder
- Level-order

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Insert
- Search
- Sorted traversal property

### AVL Tree (Self-Balancing BST)
- Insertions with rotations
- Height and balance factors

---

## Applications Included

### Family Tree
Represents family relationships using parent-child structure.

### File System Simulation
Simulates folder/file hierarchy using a tree structure.

### Decision Tree Concept
Explains tree-based decision making used in Machine Learning.
